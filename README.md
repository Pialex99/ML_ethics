# ML_ethics

Here is a game made during the *How People Learn II* class given by [Roland Tormey](https://people.epfl.ch/roland.tormey) at EPFL in 2021.

## How to run the game

- On MacOS: 
    Run the `ML_ethics.app` application, you might get a warning _“ML_ethics” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified_. In that case you need to open system preference -> _Security & Privacy_ then click on _Open Anyway_.
- On Linux:
    Run the `ML_ethics.sh` script.
- On Windows:
    Run the `Ml_ethics.exe` application.
